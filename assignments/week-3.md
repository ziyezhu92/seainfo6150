# INFO6150 Week 3 Assignments

## create a component
Create a functional component that displays the news article from <a href="./week-3-article.md">assignments/week-3-article.md</a> and some accompanying data.

The text should be marked up with valid, semantically-appropriate HTML. Consider block level and inline HTML elements, what kind of text this is and how you should properly cite the author, the date, etc.

You must name this component src/Article.js

Article.js must accept 4 props and display all of them when the component is called:
* title: "The Statue of Liberty's torch heads to new museum"
* date: "November 22, 2018"
* author: "Kate Farley"
* children: the marked-up text of the article from <a href="./week-3-article.md">assignments/week-3-article.md</a>, enclosed by the Article.js open and closing tag.


## use the component
In src/App.js, import and use the functional component so that it is displayed on the main app page (http://localhost:3000). Don't forget to pass the marked-up text of the article as the component's children prop (enclosed by the Article.js open and closing tag).
