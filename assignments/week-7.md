# INFO6150 Week 7 Assignments

## create a new layout for the articles list
Create as many new components as you think appropriate to create a layout framework for the news articles as shown in <a href="./week-7-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a>. Your components should have semantically-valid, accessible HTML.

## style the components
Create styles for your new components (and update the styles for the ArticleList/ArticleListItem/ArticleImage components from last week) to match <a href="./week-7-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a> as closely as possible.

The red header where `The INFO6150 News` is displayed **must** use flexbox styling in some way.

The grey section where the articles are display **must** use grid styling in some way.

## send me an email!
Send an email to me (a.bingham@northeaster.edu) and Sangita (bist.s@husky.neu.edu) with a link to your github repo.
