# INFO6150 Week 6 Assignments

## create an article image componennt
Create a new functional component in the `ArticleList` directory that displays the image associated with each of the news articles in `seainfo6150-webapp/src/data/articles.json`.

Your component must be named `ArticleList/ArticleImage.js` and must accept 2 props:

* url: a string
* title: a string

Your image must have semantically-valid, accessible HTML. Style the image in the article as shown in <a href="./week-6-list-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a> using a CSS module created for the ArticleImage component.

## use the article image component
In the appropriate component, import and use the new `ArticleImage.js` so that each article is displayed with its image as shown in as shown in <a href="./week-6-list-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a>.

## style the components
Create more styles for your article list components to match <a href="./week-6-list-screenshot.png">this screenshot</a> as closely as possible.
